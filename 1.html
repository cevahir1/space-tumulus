 <h1> cairnpapple hill</h1>

 <p>

  <br>

The Romans when they came by on a reconnaissance trip in the early Christian era
recorded the ancient cairn of Cairnpapple as “media nemeton”, meaning “central
sanctuary” of the highest order of Druids. Set upon the one thousand feet summit of the
Bathgate Hills, the view on a clear day extends to Goat Fell on the isle of Arran in the west
and Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth in the east. The central belt of Scotland is a narrow
isthmus of land bound by the Firths of Clyde and Forth and Cairnpapple affords the best
view of it all. Renowned as a wisdom school, Cairnpapple was one of Scotland’s foremost
centres for learning.

<br>
<br>

The oldest monument extant in the Bathgate Hills is without doubt Cairnpapple.
Cairnpapple was discovered immediately after the Second World War – all that was
discernable at the time was a rough circular embankment known as a henge monument –
and a central cairn set in a rather random-looking position within the circle. All was
overgrown with long grass with a strange octagonal turf wall surrounding it – there used
to be a plantation of trees within this but only a few remained. Professor Stuart Piggott
excavated this late Neolithic site in 1947 and 1948. He discovered a complex site – the site
is like a jigsaw puzzle with an overlaying sense of presence that lends that crucial element
to any sacred site. A multi-coloured plasticene model of the site at various stages through
history is on display in the Nissan hut managed by Historic Scotland on site – this is the
best visual representation of its multi-layered use.

<br>
<br>

The earliest evidence of human usage of site was 3500 BC when (ceremonial?) fires were
lit by the Neolithic farmers who would have lived in the plains below. Axe heads from
Cumbria and Wales were found in the hearths, proving that movement between these
areas dates back much further than Celtic times. (In the sixth century AD these old Celtic
kingdoms welcomed the migrating Celtic tribes from mid-Scotland who were ousted by
the Saxons).

The second phase of use of site is marked by a Class 2 henge (henge with double opening)
which dates from around 3000 BC. The henge surrounded twenty four upright posts,
which Piggot believed were stone. Later theories supported wooden posts, but there has
been some recent reversion to support the idea of it being a stone circle. The circle can be
2/6 more accurately described as an oval, and there are two inliers that align with their
respective partner stones identified in the oval: one of these sets is to one side of the north
entrance and another set in the vicinity of the south entrance.

<br>
<br>

When standing in the north entrance and facing southwards the southernmost uprising of the moon would be seen in midsummer

<br>

When the moon rose in its southernmost position on the south west horizon, anyone standing between the inlier and its partner stone would have been in direct alignment with the moon and would appear as if shrouded in moonlight. This may have been one of the purposes of the inlier – so the person stood between the inlier and outer stone they would appear to be haloed with moonshine amid the dramatic backdrop of the stones. The wide entrances suggest that many people passed through into the circle for some ceremonial purpose.

<br>
<br>

Three central cairns were added when the circle as a ceremonial site became obsolete; a series of three successive burials were placed with ceremonial Beaker pots. The first and largest grave is known as the North grave and is over the site where the early fires were lit. If you extend the line connecting a stone in the circle with its counterpart inlier stone at the north entrance it reaches the tip of the North grave where the largest stone stands 2.4 meters high, although before the site was excavated very little of if showed above the surface! Nowadays the central burial cairns inside the circle are protected with a concrete dome that has then been grassed over, so it is not possible to see straight across the circle as it was in ancient days.

<br>
<br>

The North grave is unparalleled in Scotland - whoever was buried here was wrapped in some form of organic material and her grave strewn with flowers. Her face was covered with a burnt wooden mask and a burnt club or mace placed alongside her. The find evokes strong emotions among many of the local people, who believe the person buried was female and connected to fertility.

<br>
<br>

The stone oval and ovoid henge is reminiscent of the female ovulation circle dictated by the Moon, and there is an alignment with the moon in the laying of this grave. The head of the grave is on its alignment. Interestingly the Bathgate Hills are often perceived as being “feminine” in character. Perhaps the site was dedicated to the moon as it lay in close proximity to a precious mineral that held associations with that planet: silver.

Immediately beside the cairn, within a stone’s throw of the summit lie the ancient Hilderstane Silver Mines that were used until the seventeenth century. The Crown Jewels on display in Edinburgh Castle were made from the silver in these mines as it yielded the best quality silver to be found in Scotland.
